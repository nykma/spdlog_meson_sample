** FAQ

*** How to add more dependency libraries?

    1. Find a =.wrap= file for your dependency on [[https://wrapdb.mesonbuild.com/][WrapDB]] (or write one by your own).
    2. put the =.wrap= file under =subprojects/=.
    3. =meson subprojects download=
    4. =meson --reconfigure builddir=
    5. =cd builddir && ninja && ./main=

*** How to satisfy my IDE to do code completion / documentation job?

    If your LSP or IDE supports =compile_commands.json= config (such as [[https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls/wiki/Project-Setup#ninja][ccls]]),
    this JSON file is already generated by meson, which is lying in =builddir= folder.

*** Your boilerplate sucks / That's not the best practice / ...

    Yes I know I'm not a player of the C world (which is too scary for me :).
    Just doing this for my own archive (or perhaps helping some other unlucky guys I guess?).
